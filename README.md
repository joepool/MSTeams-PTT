# Teams Push to Talk
A work in progress Java Application to bring push to talk functionality to Microsoft Teams.
 
I have chosen to archive this project.   
It is way to resource heavy constantly polling key presses whenever the app is running, and the delay between pressing the key and being able to speak is too long, espicaially as i am using python and pyautogui to send the key presses, as i couldn't get something like java's robot class to work ouside of the application.   
Also, it required too many depandancies, java, python, pyautogui, and my code is a bit of a disaster anyway.
